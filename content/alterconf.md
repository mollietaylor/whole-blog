Summary: Yesterday, I attended AlterConf here in Atlanta. These are my takeaways from the event.

Yesterday, I attended [AlterConf](http://www.alterconf.com/sessions/atlanta-ga) here in Atlanta. Thanks to [The Iron Yard](http://theironyard.com/) for sponsoring the event and giving me a chance to attend. Here are my takeaways from some of the talks:

###The 12 Year Old I.T. Guy, Nicholas Black
* It's not who you are that holds you back. Telling yourself you're not something is what holds you back.

###Why Diversity in Video Games Matters, Imran Khan
* "Video games where I can identify with the main character are more engaging than video games where I cannot."
* 80% of black characters in video games are in sports games.

###Context for People of Color, Juwan Platt
* There is a lack of context in the community about how coding fits into the world.
* Context → content → diversity

###Professionally Prepared but Not Pioneer Prepared, Monica F. Cox
* In 2012, there were about 150 female African American engineering professors in the U.S. 
* "I was prepared to be a professor, but I was not prepared to be a pioneer."

###The Labors of Inclusivity, Mariam Asad & Sarah Schoemann 
* How do you practice the value of diversity?

###Job Listing Minesweeper, Pamela Vickers
* Mines: 
	* We like a homogeneous team
	* Rigid requirements
	* Vague structure/policies
	* Zealously mediocre
	* Aggressive language

###The Experience of Access, Laurel Lawson
* Everyone on a team is responsible for UX.
* Accessibility means people can use what you build in the manner of their choice.
* Our architecture should not dictate how people use what we build.
* Even in diverse teams, vision is limited. A team of 4-8 people can only have so much diversity.
* Diverse user bases are bigger and more profitable.
* Access to culture, access to education, access to space
* Access should be easy.


##My Overall Takeaways:
* Be yourself; own it.
* What you do can have unintended consequences (good, bad, or neutral).
* Live captioning should be the standard for conferences.
