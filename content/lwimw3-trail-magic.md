Summary: I just finished my submission for Look What I Made Weekend 3.

I just finished my submission for [Look What I Made Weekend 3](http://lookwhatimadeweekend.com/). Look What I Made Weekend (LWIMW) is a chance for people to create something over the course of 48 hours. The concept is based on [Ludum Dare](http://www.ludumdare.com/) and other game jams, but for LWIMW you don't have to make a game. Instead, you are free to pursue any creative endeavor and show off your results at the end.

> NB: The content below is mostly a reprint of [my submission at LWIMW](http://lookwhatimadeweekend.com/contest/3/submission/110/).

My project is an interactive website that will be part of the companion site to a book [my friend Scott Thigpen](http://www.driven2divide.com/) is writing.
I didn't quite start from scratch on this project. This image shows the progress I had made before the weekend. You can also view it [on the web](http://mollietaylor.com/trailmagic/preLWIMW-slide.html).

The other images show the current status after the weekend.

I made a lot of progress this weekend. I added GPS routes to the map, added a table of contents, added marker clustering, improved the graphic design (CSS and basemap), and added about 25% of the final content.

The only essential things I have left to do are adding the rest of the content, working with my friend on palette and graphics, and tweaking some small things.
