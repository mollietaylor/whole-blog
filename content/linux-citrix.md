Summary: I had some difficulty figuring out how to get Citrix XenDesktop to work properly on Linux.

I had some difficulty figuring out how to get Citrix XenDesktop to work properly on Linux.

I was having the same problem I had had on Windows â€” when I would try to access XenDesktop, the browser would try to download launch.ica instead of running it.

##Citrix Receiver
However, on other operating systems, I had always downloaded the Citrix Online Plug-in to fix the problem. For some reason, the Citrix Online Plug-in is not available for Linux. However, the [Citrix Receiver](http://receiver.citrix.com/?ntref=receiverdownload) is available for Linux, and seems to do the same thing.

After installing Citrix Receiver, your browser will ask for your permission to run it.

##Open Motif
You may need to install Open Motif before you can install Citrix Receiver.

If so, download Open Motif, extract it, and follow the directions in INSTALL.configure, namely:

	:::console
	cd
	./configure
	make check
	make install
	make clean

##Security Certificate

If you try to log on to your virtual desktop and get an error about "AddTrust External CA Root", you can just do

	:::console
	sudo cp /usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/*.* /opt/Citrix/ICAClient/keystore/cacerts/
